    "description": "Accurate and early detection of causes of pneumonia is important for implementing fast treatment and preventive strategies, reducing the burden of infections, and establishing more effective ways of interventions. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the new cases of pneumonia and conditions of breathing problems called acute respiratory distress syndrome have increased. Chest radiography, known as CXR or simply X-ray has become a significant source to diagnose COVID-19-infected pneumonia in designated institutions and hospitals. It is essential to develop automated computer systems to assist doctors and medical experts to diagnose pneumonia in a fast and reliable manner. In this work, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based computer-aided diagnosis system for rapid and easy detection of pneumonia using X-ray images. To improve classification accuracy and faster conversion of the models, we employ transfer learning and parallel computing techniques using well-known DL models such as VGG19 and ResNet50. Experiments are conducted on the large COVID-QU-Ex dataset of X-ray images with three classes, such as COVID-19-infected pneumonia, non-COVID-19 infections (other viral and bacterial pneumonia), and normal (uninfected) images. The proposed model outperformed compared methodologies, achieving an average classification accuracy of 96.6%. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in diagnosing pneumonia using X-ray images.",

    "description": "Breast cancer screening and detection using high-resolution mammographic images have always been a difficult task in computer vision due to the presence of very small yet clinically significant abnormal growths in breast masses. The size difference between such masses and the overall mammogram image as well as difficulty in distinguishing intra-class features of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS) categories creates challenges for accurate diagnosis. To obtain near-optimal results, object detection models should be improved by directly focusing on breast cancer detection. In this work, we propose a new two-stage deep learning method. In the first stage, the breast area is extracted from the mammogram and small square patches are generated to narrow down the region of interest (RoI). In the second stage, breast masses are detected and classified into BI-RADS categories. To improve the classification accuracy for intra-classes, we design an effective tumor classification model and combine its results with the detection modelâ€™s classification scores. Experiments conducted on the newly collected high-resolution mammography dataset demonstrate our two-stage method outperforms the original Faster R-CNN model by improving mean average precision (mAP) from 0.85 to 0.94. In addition, comparisons with existing works on a popular INbreast dataset validate the performance of our two-stage model.",
